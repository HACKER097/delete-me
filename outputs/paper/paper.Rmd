abstract: "Suppose that in the late twenty-first century, astronomers announce the receipt of a candidate message from extraterrestrial intelligence. They provide information about the message itself and about the candidate planet of origin. In this paper, we assess the authenticity of the candidate message, the likelihood that it comes from the candidate planet, and the possible biochemistry of the senders."
